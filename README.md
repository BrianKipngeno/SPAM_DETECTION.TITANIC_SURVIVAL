**KNN- CLASSIFIER AND NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFIER**

This is a repository containing two python notebooks, a KNN classification model prediction and a naive bayes classification model prediction respectively. I built a model that predicted whether a passenger survived the titanic using the titanic dataset using the KNN model and used the spam dataset to build a model that predicted whether an email is a spam or not using The Naive Bayes classification model.
